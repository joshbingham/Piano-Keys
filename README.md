Developed an interactive browser-based piano interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate real-time user input handling and responsive visual feedback. Built features that detect correct musical note sequences and trigger lyric progression, strengthening understanding of arrays, conditionals, and event-driven program flow.

- Implemented DOM-based keypress interactions with dynamic styling to simulate realistic piano key behaviour.
- Added logic to validate note sequences and advance through lyrics based on player accuracy.
- Structured the project with clear, reusable functions for input handling, state tracking, and UI updates, improving maintainability and scalability.
